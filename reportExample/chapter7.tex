\section{Summary}

Nowadays, we have exercised using the keyboard for long periods of time, so it seems easier to control a game in this mode, but if we put more practice into playing with an EEG and properly training the Cognitiv suite, we could achieve same results with much less of an effort. \cite{moviebrain} shows it is possible to use an fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to see quite similar pictures with what the participant is seeing while watching a movie.
