The aim of the project is to provide an overview of the development of CogniDriver, a 3D mind-controlled car driving game which uses the Emotiv EPOC interface to control the car movement. The headset also allows the activation of various game effects such as raining when the frustration levels are too high or changing the camera view when the player does a left wink.

The Unity game engine has been used while developing the game in order to gain access to an advanced physics engine and to a multi-platform deployment tool.

The results of user testing on 13 participants have shown that although it is more difficult to control the game while in Cognitiv mode, the game appears more challenging and more interactive than a normal Keyboard mode play. 

In the conclusions, a short overview of the current deficiencies are presented as well as potential for further development.
