Cognitiv: 
For using the cognitiv game play mode, a player profile will first need to be trained in the "Train Headset" tab. The recommendation is to train the Neutral state a few times while in a relaxed mode, trying not to think about anything. Next, one should proceed to training once all of the other states Push, Pull, Left and Right. On first training, try to be relaxed. After all states have been trained once, proceed to training the Push action. First reset your training so far, and concentrate on visualising how the cube is being pushed to the back of the virtual room. The percentage next to the name of the action, shows how well you can do that state. It represents the skill level. After training it once, the next time you're going to do it, you will see the cube being animated to give it visual clues as to how well you're doing the same thing. If the cube is not moving at all, after multiple trainings, you should probably start over by resetting the action. If you're doing it good, and the skill level is not 0 but you can't move the cube this one try during training, just reject the training at the end as it will otherwise have a negative effect on your skill level. Proceed to training the other states, pull, left and right in a similar way. The push, pull, left, right actions will be used to control the movement of the car.
